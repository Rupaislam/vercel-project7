<p>An analysis of pollen from Lake Volvi in Greece has unexpectedly revealed that nomads thrived in this region for centuries after the chaos unleashed by <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2414350-plagues-that-shook-the-roman-empire-linked-to-cold-dry-periods/">the collapse of the Roman Empire</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shh.mpg.de/person/60036/2375">Adam Izdebski</a> at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Germany and his colleagues were <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2302151-people-occupied-the-faroe-islands-300-years-earlier-than-we-thought/">studying sediment cores</a> from the lake as part of a larger study. As lake sediments build up, changes in the abundance of various kinds of pollen in the sediment layers can <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2402214-ancient-europe-was-half-covered-by-savannah-and-grazed-by-elephants/">record how nearby vegetation changed over time</a>.</p>
<p>In some other places around the Mediterranean, the team has found signs of reforestation after <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19968-fall-of-roman-empire-linked-to-wild-shifts-in-climate/">the collapse of the Western Roman Empire</a> around AD 476. But at Lake Volvi, from around AD 540, the team found less tree pollen but more pollen from plants associated with nomadic livestock herders. <span style="color: #000000;">These nomads were returning to the same areas seasonally, so planted some crops, such as barley.</span></p>
<p>“We have this moment when the Roman agriculture disappears almost completely due to plague, climate change and warfare, but you don’t get reforestation – you actually get less forest very quickly,” says Izdebski.</p>
<p><span class="js-content-prompt-opportunity"/></p>
<p>“The landscape was dominated by pasture animals even in the high mountain areas. This was a complete shift from how the Romans farmed the lowlands for several hundred years.”</p>
<p>This means those earlier farmers moved away, died or adopted a nomadic lifestyle, he says.</p>
<p>Greece was nominally under the control of the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire around at the time of this shift. It is known that the region was raided by Bulgar nomads around AD 540, but it wasn’t known that nomads lived in this region for several centuries.</p>
<p>The only historical information that correlates with the team’s findings is an account of a Byzantine emperor being ambushed by Bulgar nomads around AD 700.</p>
<p>“It seems that there was a local society that didn’t want any emperor to be around,” says Izdebski, who presented the findings at the meeting of the European Geosciences Union in Vienna, Austria, last month.</p>
<p>Around AD 850, the Byzantine Empire reasserted control and the signs of nomads disappear. Instead, there was reforestation.</p>
<p>The findings provide rare evidence of the presence of <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25734240-100-stunning-photos-show-nomadic-life-of-mongolian-goat-herders/">nomadic peoples</a> at a particular place and time, says Izdebski. “We know very little about their history because the states were not interested in recording them.”</p>
<p>Historians didn’t write about nomadic peoples as they weren’t part of the elites, he says. And because nomads were difficult to tax, there are no tax records either – tax records can be a rich source of information about past populations.</p>

<p>Is it possible to be “addicted” to eating unhealthy food? Yes, says a group of doctors and scientists who are going against mainstream medical advice to declare a provocative new way to think about overeating.</p>
<p>The idea isn’t entirely new, as a few researchers have been arguing for years that some people overeat so much that their relationship with food should be seen as an addiction. But because it seems different to other kinds of addictions, such as when people are dependent on alcohol or take…</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24933160-800-low-carb-diets-an-easy-way-to-lose-weight-or-recipe-for-heart-attack/">ketogenic diet</a> causes damaged cells to accumulate in the organs of mice. Their build-up suggests the keto diet may accelerate organ ageing, raising the risk of conditions like heart disease and cancer.</p>
<p>Although many people have adopted low-carbohydrate diets like keto for <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2419751-keto-diet-helps-people-maintain-weight-loss-after-stopping-ozempic/">weight loss and controlling blood sugar</a>, research on their health effects is mixed, with some studies finding they increase the risk of heart attacks.</p>
<p>To learn more, <a href="https://directory.uthscsa.edu/academics/profile/gius">David Gius</a> at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and his colleagues fed six mice a ketogenic diet for three weeks. More than 90 per cent of their calories came from fat and less than 1 per cent from carbohydrates. A control group ate a standard diet where 17 per cent of calories came from fat and 58 per cent came from carbohydrates.</p>
<p>The researchers then analysed heart, kidney, liver and brain tissue samples from the mice, looking for senescent cells. <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25834394-600-a-new-class-of-anti-ageing-drugs-has-arrived-which-ones-really-work/">Senescence</a> occurs when cells become too damaged to function, but instead of dying, they enter a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2406146-removing-zombie-like-cells-may-help-treat-multiple-sclerosis/">zombie-like</a> state. These cells linger in tissues, spewing toxins that stoke inflammation.</p>
<p><span class="js-content-prompt-opportunity"/></p>
<p>Animals on the ketogenic diet had significantly more senescent cells in their organs compared with those on a standard diet. For instance, their kidneys contained, on average, four times the amount of a marker of cellular senescence as those from animals fed a regular diet.</p>
<p>Senescent cells increase with age. So, these findings suggest the keto diet might accelerate organ ageing, which would raise the risk of conditions like heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes. However, switching mice back to a standard diet decreased senescent cells.</p>
<p>“While the ketogenic diet is probably a good thing, [it is not for] everyone. And importantly, you need to take a break,” says Gius. “I think our paper really says we need to study this more rigorously.”</p>
<p>It isn’t clear how these experimental findings may translate to people, says <a href="https://russelljoneslab.vai.org/?tabUrl=lead-investigator">Russell Jones</a> at the Van Andel Institute in Michigan. “They’re running a 90 per cent fat diet, and that would be virtually impossible to adhere to as a human,” he says.</p>

<p>Physics is in a crisis. Over the past year, a series of research papers claimed to find evidence for high-temperature superconductors – materials that conduct electricity without losses, which could revolutionise global energy use. These were retracted after <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2364955-red-matter-superconductor-may-not-be-a-wonder-material-after-all/">all efforts to reproduce them failed</a>, and in some cases original data was shown to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00976-y">have been falsified</a>. Now, physicists are sounding the alarm about a wider reproducibility crisis in their field.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:102">Hold onto your spacesuits! Astronomers have unveiled the discovery of a rocky planet eerily similar to Earth, reigniting our quest for extraterrestrial life. Located a mere 55 light-years away – a cosmic hop in astronomical terms – this newfound world has sparked excitement amongst scientists, offering a tantalizing glimpse into a potential abode for life beyond our solar system.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:38"><strong>A Rocky Replica: Unveiling SPECULOOS-3 b</strong></p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:124">The newfound planet, aptly named SPECULOOS-3 b, orbits a cool red dwarf star within the constellation Sextans. Classified as an &#8220;exoplanet,&#8221; meaning it resides outside our solar system, SPECULOOS-3 b is roughly the size of Earth. This similarity in size alone has astronomers buzzing, as it places SPECULOOS-3 b within the range of potentially harboring conditions suitable for life as we know it.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:145">While Earth is bathed in the warm glow of our Sun, SPECULOOS-3 b orbits a much cooler and fainter red dwarf star. This raises questions about the planet&#8217;s potential habitability. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of what we know so far:</p>
<ul data-sourcepos="11:1-13:400">
<li data-sourcepos="11:1-12:0">
<p data-sourcepos="11:3-11:456"><strong>The Goldilocks Zone: Maybe Not Quite Right</strong> – Our Sun emits a range of radiation, and planets within a specific zone around it receive the right amount of heat to allow liquid water to exist on their surfaces – a key ingredient for life. Unfortunately, SPECULOOS-3 b orbits its star much closer than Earth orbits the Sun. This close proximity might subject the planet to scorching temperatures, potentially rendering its surface unsuitable for life.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="13:1-13:400">
<p data-sourcepos="13:3-13:400"><strong>Tidally Locked Dance:</strong> Another intriguing aspect of SPECULOOS-3 b is the possibility that it&#8217;s tidally locked with its star. This means one side of the planet perpetually faces the star, basking in its constant light, while the other side remains in perpetual darkness. Such extremes in temperature could potentially create a thin atmosphere on the dayside, while the nightside remains frigid.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:61"><strong>Beyond Habitability: A New Frontier for Planetary Science</strong></p>
<p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:170">While the jury&#8217;s still out on whether SPECULOOS-3 b could support life, its discovery holds immense significance for our understanding of planetary formation. Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<ul data-sourcepos="19:1-22:0">
<li data-sourcepos="19:1-20:0">
<p data-sourcepos="19:3-19:303"><strong>Rocky Companions for Cool Stars:</strong> Red dwarf stars are the most common type of star in our galaxy. Prior to SPECULOOS-3 b, very few rocky planets had been found orbiting these cooler stars. This discovery suggests that rocky planets may be more prevalent around red dwarfs than previously thought.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="21:1-22:0">
<p data-sourcepos="21:3-21:466"><strong>A Laboratory for Studying Alien Geology:</strong> SPECULOOS-3 b&#8217;s proximity to Earth makes it a prime candidate for further study. Powerful telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could potentially analyze the planet&#8217;s atmosphere, if it has one, revealing its composition and searching for biosignatures – potential signs of life. Additionally, studying the geology of SPECULOOS-3 b could shed light on how planets form around different types of stars.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:63"><strong>The Search Continues: A Universe Teeming with Possibilities</strong></p>
<p data-sourcepos="25:1-25:28">The discovery of SPECULOOS-3 b adds another exciting chapter to humanity&#8217;s ongoing quest to find life beyond Earth. While this particular planet might not be our cosmic twin, it serves as a powerful reminder that our solar system is just one tiny speck in a vast and potentially teeming universe.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:385">Astronomers are constantly scanning the skies for new exoplanets, and with each discovery, we get closer to finding a world that could truly be called Earth&#8217;s &#8220;twin.&#8221; The hunt for extraterrestrial life is no longer science fiction; it&#8217;s a scientific endeavor filled with promise, and discoveries like SPECULOOS-3 b fuel our collective imagination and inspire us to reach for the stars.</p>
